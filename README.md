A makeshift method of recording a demo of my gain + pitch shift plugin, but it shows how the gain slider and pitch shift toggle work. You might notice a minor echo as the generated output (external speaker) is recaptured and reprocessed by the input source (MacBook microphone). But, if you plug in headphones to isolate the generated output from the input source, this echo dissipates and you can hear clean, processed audio according to the plugin settings!
