A makeshift method of recording a demo of my gain + pitch shift plugin, but it shows how the gain slider and pitch shift toggle work. Here is the setup: I am playing the featured video on my phone, which captured by my MacBook's microphone, my input source. This is processed according to the active gain and pitch shift settings, and output through an external bluetooth speaker. Both the audio going in and coming out is captured, which is why you can hear the original voice of the speaker, followed by a trailing, processed voice of the speaker. 

You might notice a minor echo as the generated output is recaptured and reprocessed by the input source. If desired, you can plug in headphones to isolate the generated output from the input source. Then, this echo dissipates and you can hear a cleaner output!
